# Geographic Optimization Dashboard - Feature Summary

## Overview

The EMD Manning Dashboard has been enhanced with comprehensive geographic optimization features, providing commanders with visual, interactive tools to optimize personnel assignments based on location, distance, and travel costs.

## New Features

### 1. Manning Document Page Enhancements

**Location Selection:**
- Expanded from 7 to **56 military installations** worldwide
- Includes all major CONUS, INDOPACOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM, SOUTHCOM, and CENTCOM bases
- Auto-categorizes by AOR (Area of Responsibility)
- Displays CONUS/OCONUS status

**Smart Profile Recommendations:**
- Automatically suggests appropriate readiness profile based on selected location
- Examples:
  - NTC ‚Üí "NTC Rotation (30 days)"
  - Camp Humphreys ‚Üí "INDOPACOM Exercise (14 days)"
  - Grafenwoehr ‚Üí "EUCOM Exercise (21 days)"

**Location Information Display:**
- Shows AOR, country, and installation type
- Provides context for exercise planning

### 2. Optimization Page Enhancements

**Advanced Readiness Profiles:**
- 10 location-specific profiles (4 CONUS, 6 AOR-specific)
- Profiles include:
  - NTC Rotation, JRTC Rotation, TDY Exercise, Home Station Exercise
  - INDOPACOM Exercise/Rotation, EUCOM Exercise, SOUTHCOM Exercise, AFRICOM Exercise, CENTCOM Deployment
- Each profile shows duration, AOR, and number of training gates

**Geographic Policy Tuning:**
New sliders in the Policy Tuning section:
- **Geographic Cost Weight** (0.0 - 2.0): Controls how heavily travel costs influence assignments
- **Same Theater Bonus** (-$500 to $0): Rewards soldiers already in destination AOR
- **OCONUS Lead Time Penalty** ($0 - $1,000): Accounts for coordination complexity
- **Distance Penalty per 1000 mi** ($0 - $200): Additional cost for complexity beyond base travel

**Integration with EMD:**
- Automatically sets exercise location for geographic calculations
- Applies all geographic policies during optimization
- Seamlessly integrates with existing readiness and cohesion logic

### 3. Analysis Page - New Geographic Section

**Interactive World Map (OpenStreetMap + Folium):**
- Exercise location marked with red star icon ‚≠ê
- Source bases shown with circle markers sized by soldier count
- Color-coded by AOR:
  - NORTHCOM = Blue
  - INDOPACOM = Red
  - EUCOM = Green
  - AFRICOM = Yellow
  - CENTCOM = Purple
  - SOUTHCOM = Orange
- Flight path lines connecting source bases to exercise location
- Line colors indicate cost tier (green=cheap, orange=medium, red=expensive)
- Interactive popups showing:
  - Base name, soldier count
  - Distance in miles
  - Cost per soldier and total cost
  - AOR designation
- Built-in legend for AOR colors and cost tiers

**Travel Cost Dashboard:**
- **Total Travel Cost**: Aggregate travel cost for all assignments
- **Average Cost per Soldier**: With min/max range
- **Average Distance**: With min/max range
- **Cost Optimization Score**: Percentage saved vs worst-case scenario

**Cost Breakdown Visualizations:**
- **Pie Chart**: Travel cost distribution by tier (ground, domestic flight, international)
- **Histogram**: Soldier distribution by distance from exercise location

**Sourcing Analysis Table:**
Detailed breakdown by source base including:
- Distance from exercise location
- Number of soldiers sourced
- Total cost and average cost per soldier
- Cost Efficiency rating (üü¢ Excellent, üü° Good, üî¥ Expensive)
- Automatically ranks bases by cost-effectiveness

**AI-Powered Recommendations:**
- Identifies most cost-effective source base
- Highlights most expensive sources if significantly above average
- Provides specific cost comparison (e.g., "45% more expensive than Fort Carson")
- Suggests future sourcing priorities

## Installation Requirements

To use the full geographic features, install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install folium streamlit-folium
```

**Note:** The system gracefully degrades if these packages are not available. Core EMD functionality works without them, but interactive maps won't be displayed.

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Force Generation
Generate or upload your MTOE-based force as usual.

### Step 2: Manning Document
1. Select exercise name
2. **Choose from 56 worldwide locations** (new!)
3. Review auto-recommended profile based on location
4. Add capability requirements

### Step 3: Optimization
1. Verify auto-selected readiness profile (now includes 10 advanced profiles)
2. **Tune geographic policies** (new section in Advanced settings)
   - Adjust geographic cost weight to control travel cost influence
   - Set same-theater bonus to prefer soldiers already in-theater
   - Configure OCONUS penalties and distance complexity factors
3. Run optimization (geographic penalties automatically applied)

### Step 4: Analysis
1. Review standard metrics (fill rate, costs, sourcing)
2. **Scroll to Geographic & Travel Analysis section** (new!)
3. Interact with world map to visualize sourcing decisions
4. Review travel cost breakdown and efficiency metrics
5. Read AI-generated sourcing recommendations

## Technical Details

### Geographic Calculations

**Distance Formula:**
- Haversine great-circle distance
- Accurate for global calculations
- Returns distances in miles

**Travel Cost Model:**
- **Ground (<500 mi)**: $150 + $0.67/mile
- **Domestic Flight (500-3000 mi)**: $400 + $0.15/mile
- **International (>3000 mi)**: $1200 + $0.20/mile
- **Per Diem**: $150/day CONUS, $200/day OCONUS

**Cost Penalty Calculation:**
```
Total Geographic Cost =
  (Travel Cost √ó Geographic Weight) +
  (OCONUS Lead Time Penalty if applicable) +
  (Same Theater Bonus if applicable) +
  (Distance / 1000 √ó Distance Penalty)
```

### Map Features

**Marker Sizing:**
- Circle radius scales with soldier count (5-20 pixels)
- Larger circles = more soldiers from that base

**Color Coding:**
- Circle border: AOR color
- Circle fill: Cost tier color
- Lines: Cost tier color (green/orange/red)

**Interactivity:**
- Click markers for detailed popups
- Zoom and pan controls
- Tooltips on hover

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** INDOPACOM Exercise at Camp Humphreys, Korea

**Dashboard Shows:**
- Map with Camp Humphreys marked with red star in Korea
- Source bases across CONUS and Pacific
- Flight paths from each base to Korea
- Cost breakdown:
  - Camp Zama (Japan): $2,085/soldier (green line) ‚Üê Most cost-effective
  - Schofield Barracks (Hawaii): $3,104/soldier (orange line)
  - JBLM (Washington): $3,505/soldier (orange line)
  - Fort Bragg (NC): $4,436/soldier (red line) ‚Üê Most expensive

**Recommendation:**
"Most Cost-Effective: Camp Zama - 15 soldiers at $2,085/soldier, 696 miles from Camp Humphreys. Consider prioritizing this base for future sourcing."
