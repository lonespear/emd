## üí° Real-World Example

### Scenario: INDOPACOM Exercise at Camp Humphreys, Korea

**Dashboard Shows**:
- Interactive map with Camp Humphreys marked (red star) in Korea
- Source bases across Pacific and CONUS with flight paths
- Color-coded lines showing travel costs

**Cost Analysis**:
| Base | Distance | Cost/Soldier | Rating |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Camp Zama (Japan) | 696 mi | $2,085 | üü¢ Excellent |
| Schofield Barracks (HI) | 4,529 mi | $3,104 | üü° Good |
| JBLM (WA) | 5,214 mi | $3,505 | üü° Good |
| Fort Bragg (NC) | 7,182 mi | $4,436 | üî¥ Expensive |

**AI Recommendation**:
"Most Cost-Effective: Camp Zama - 15 soldiers at $2,085/soldier, 696 miles from Camp Humphreys. Consider prioritizing this base for future sourcing. 53% more cost-effective than Fort Bragg."
